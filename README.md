# Vertica.Utilities v4

Helpers, value objects, pattern implementations... and a bag of chips

## Get it
From version 5.0 and on, package is **not** deployed to Vertica's internal package feed, but to NuGet's public one.
Or... one can always build from source using either Visual Studio 2017 or a .NET Core SDK.
