## Get it
From version 5.0 and on, package is **not** deployed to Vertica's internal package feed, but to [NuGet's public feed](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vertica.Utilities/) or [AppVeyor's project feed](https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/vertica-utilities-6mjrfbi807ea).

Or... one can always build from source using either Visual Studio 2017 or a .NET Core SDK.

```sh
> dotnet build-local
```
